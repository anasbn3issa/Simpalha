    STEP 1 Completed at 11h45

    STEP 2:
        -Complete the "Question" class CRUD scenario

    STEP 2 Completed at 23h57

    Notes:
        *Following the GUI tutorial to make the interface a bit richer and more fluid. This is going to be complicated.
        *Added a few tweaks to make changing scenes independent from controllers. Meaning you can change scenes from different controllers not only ONE controller like the example I'm referencing below.
